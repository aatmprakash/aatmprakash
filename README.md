## [Luvkush Chat AI](https://github.com/aatmprakash/Luvkush-AI-chat)

This project is a chatAI built with Next.js and React. It allows users to interact with a chatbot that responds using the Generative Language API. The component maintains a conversation history and displays messages in a user-friendly format.
### Features

- Real-time chat with a chatbot.
- Displays user and bot messages with styling.
- Tailwind css and other lib used.
- Typing indicator ans animation when the bot is generating a response.
- Integrated with the Generative Language API for generating responses.

## [Comment and review Analysis with AI](https://github.com/aatmprakash/Summary-and-Sentiment-Nlp)
Welcome to the This is a project where you can select any product form website like amazon, or any food website and we can analyze it comments and Review! This repository aims to provide natural language processing functionalities to summarize text and analyze sentiments. We believe this project has great potential, and we are excited to invite collaborators to join us in making it even better.** It only works for yelp.com aiim to make it better**.

### Project Overview [ Looking for contributers]

The main objective of this project is to develop an NLP application that can summarize lengthy texts and perform sentiment analysis on them. With this tool, users can quickly grasp the essence of long documents and gain insights into the overall sentiment expressed in the text.

### [ResNet-34/18 Pneumonia CNN](https://github.com/aatmprakash/ResNet__34__18---Pneumonia-CNN)
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the ResNet-34/18 architecture for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. It aims to provide an automated solution for accurate diagnosis, contributing to early intervention and treatment of pneumonia.

### [U-Net Retina Blood Segmentation](https://github.com/aatmprakash/U-Net-retina-blood-segmentation)
In this project, I have developed a U-Net model for segmenting blood vessels in retinal images. This segmentation technique plays a vital role in the early detection and monitoring of various retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy.

### [Face Generation - GANs](https://github.com/aatmprakash/Face-Generation---GANs-Generative-Adversarial-Networks)
Using generative adversarial networks (GANs), this project generates realistic human faces. The GAN model learns from a dataset of real faces and produces new, synthetic faces that closely resemble the real ones. This project demonstrates my expertise in deep learning and computer vision.

### [U-Net Liver Segmentation](https://github.com/aatmprakash/U-Net-Liver-Segmentation--Monai)
The U-Net architecture is employed in this project to perform liver segmentation from medical images. Accurate liver segmentation is essential for various medical applications, including surgical planning and disease diagnosis.

### [Handwritten Digit Generation - GANs](https://github.com/aatmprakash/HandWritten-digit-Generation---GANs-Generative-Adversarial-Networks)
Using generative adversarial networks (GANs), this project generates realistic handwritten digits. The GAN model is trained on a dataset of real handwritten digits and is capable of generating new, synthetic digits that closely resemble human-written ones.

### [Advanced CNN - ResNet-18 Image Classification](https://github.com/aatmprakash/Advance-CNN-ResNet18--image-classfication)
This project focuses on image classification using the advanced CNN architecture ResNet-18. The ResNet-18 model is trained on a large dataset and achieves high accuracy in categorizing images into various classes.

### [Human Protein Labeling - Transfer Learning & Regularization](https://github.com/aatmprakash/Human-Protine-labling-Transfer-Learning-Regularization)
In this project, I explore transfer learning and regularization techniques for human protein labeling tasks. The project showcases my understanding of deep learning, transfer learning, and regularization methods in the context of bioinformatics.
