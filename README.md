## Projects

Here are some of the notable projects I have worked on:

### [ResNet-34/18 Pneumonia CNN](https://github.com/aatmprakash/ResNet__34__18---Pneumonia-CNN)
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the ResNet-34/18 architecture for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. It aims to provide an automated solution for accurate diagnosis, contributing to early intervention and treatment of pneumonia.

### [U-Net Retina Blood Segmentation](https://github.com/aatmprakash/U-Net-retina-blood-segmentation)
In this project, I have developed a U-Net model for segmenting blood vessels in retinal images. This segmentation technique plays a vital role in the early detection and monitoring of various retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy.

### [Face Generation - GANs](https://github.com/aatmprakash/Face-Generation---GANs-Generative-Adversarial-Networks)
Using generative adversarial networks (GANs), this project generates realistic human faces. The GAN model learns from a dataset of real faces and produces new, synthetic faces that closely resemble the real ones. This project demonstrates my expertise in deep learning and computer vision.

### [U-Net Liver Segmentation](https://github.com/aatmprakash/U-Net-Liver-Segmentation--Monai)
The U-Net architecture is employed in this project to perform liver segmentation from medical images. Accurate liver segmentation is essential for various medical applications, including surgical planning and disease diagnosis.

### [Handwritten Digit Generation - GANs](https://github.com/aatmprakash/HandWritten-digit-Generation---GANs-Generative-Adversarial-Networks)
Using generative adversarial networks (GANs), this project generates realistic handwritten digits. The GAN model is trained on a dataset of real handwritten digits and is capable of generating new, synthetic digits that closely resemble human-written ones.

### [Advanced CNN - ResNet-18 Image Classification](https://github.com/aatmprakash/Advance-CNN-ResNet18--image-classfication)
This project focuses on image classification using the advanced CNN architecture ResNet-18. The ResNet-18 model is trained on a large dataset and achieves high accuracy in categorizing images into various classes.

### [Human Protein Labeling - Transfer Learning & Regularization](https://github.com/aatmprakash/Human-Protine-labling-Transfer-Learning-Regularization)
In this project, I explore transfer learning and regularization techniques for human protein labeling tasks. The project showcases my understanding of deep learning, transfer learning, and regularization methods in the context of bioinformatics.
